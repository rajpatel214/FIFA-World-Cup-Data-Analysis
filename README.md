1. Title: FIFA World Cup Data Analysis Using SQL for Sky Sports Channel

2. Introduction:
In this project, I performed advanced SQL queries on FIFA World Cup data to analyze team performance, player statistics, and tactical information. The data comes from two key tables: team_stats and wc_stats, providing insight into team ranks, goals, wins, and individual player contributions like assists and passes. This analysis is valuable for sports analysts to make data-driven decisions, such as evaluating team performance and comparing players.
