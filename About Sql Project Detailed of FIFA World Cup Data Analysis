# FIFA-World-Cup-Data-Analysis-sql-project
In this project, I performed advanced SQL queries on FIFA World Cup data to analyze team performance, player statistics, and tactical information. The data comes from two key tables: team_stats and wc_stats, providing insight into team ranks, goals, wins, and individual player contributions like assists and passes. This analysis is valuable for sports analysts to make data-driven decisions, such as evaluating team performance and comparing players.

#Project Objective:
Analyze FIFA World Cup team performance data using SQL queries.
Retrieve important statistics such as goals scored, match results, player actions, and team rankings.
Make group-level comparisons and present insights in a structured manner to assist sports analysts in understanding key performance metrics.
Present data related to goalkeeper, defensive, and team performance.

#Team and Match Insights:
You retrieved unique team names from the dataset.
Identified the team ranked first in group 7.
Calculated the total number of teams participating.
Retrieved the number of matches played by each team.

#Performance Metrics:
Calculated the percentage of wins and losses for each team based on matches played.
Identified the team with the maximum and minimum number of goals scored.
Calculated the average goal difference and analyzed teams with zero points.
Compared expected goals scored and expected goals conceded for teams, showing where expectations were met or exceeded.

#Player and Team Stats:
Analyzed the number of players used and compared average player age.
Determined average possession percentage for teams and identified teams with over 600 minutes of play.
Analyzed team performance in terms of goals, assists, penalty kicks, and yellow/red cards.
Extracted data related to goals per 90 minutes, assists per 90 minutes, and shots on target percentages.

#Goalkeeper and Defensive Metrics:
Focused on goalkeeper performance, analyzing metrics such as clean sheets, penalty saves, defensive actions, and save percentage.

#Tactical and Match Performance:
Explored shot-creating actions, passes attempted, progressive passes, and passes into the final third.
Investigated fouls, aerial duels won, and offside statistics.
Compared shots and goals per shot on target for different teams.

#Group-Level Statistics:
Analyzed performance metrics at the group level by calculating average wins, expected goal differences, and the number of fouls, offsides, and games played.
Focused on average age of players per group and compared passes completion percentage and goals per 90 minutes across groups.
